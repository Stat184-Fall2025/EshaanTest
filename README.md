# Test Repo Stat 184 for Activity 15

## Plan

I created this repository and used the template provided. From there, I added the files in the repository locally, then pushed it.

My plan for maintaining this repo is periodically updating the README, and updating the files inside. The .qmd file should run fine as it is, but in order to make sure that it runs fine, I would need to add in the data to the repo, and then change the pathway that is used in the .qmd file so that it can run. Otherwise, the only way to check my progress is through the pdf file.
